# VersionUp - AI Workout Coach

ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸ”§

VersionUp is a web application designed to act as a virtual workout coach. It synchronizes with a user's Strava account to analyze their activity data. Leveraging AI, it provides personalized feedback and recommendations for future workouts based on the user's goals.

This project is mobile-first, ensuring a seamless experience on any device.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a practical learning experience for integrating Artificial Intelligence into a real-world, full-stack application. It explores the end-to-end process from data acquisition (via the Strava API) and data processing to generating intelligent, actionable insights for the user.
